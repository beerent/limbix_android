# limbix_android

Limbix is an android application very similar to a reminder app. This application focuses on speed and helps you remember when you're in a pinch or short on time. You can sort the reminders or 'limbs' with tags. A future goal was to have real time limb updates and group tags. An example here is if two people were in a grocery store, they could both be sharing a list of items to buy. When one user would check off the "eggs" from the list, the other user would see eggs get checked off, so they knew not to grab a second carton. Another use case for this is a camping trip. Six people are going camping. Design one master list, and every user crosses off the items that they already have so people don't bring two of the same item.

This project has been put on hold. I love android development, but I was finding most of the back end development and networking was complete, and most of my time was spent on trying to make the graphics look better. I do not care for graphics, so I lost interest.  I accomplished what I wanted, and new projects have come around with higher priority.
